# Sovoli Company Strategy

> **Core Philosophy**: Lean Startup. "Scrappy first."
> **Golden Rule**: Do things manually before building complex systems. If a feature does not directly contribute to the current OKRs, do not build it. Avoid engineering rabbit holes.

## 1. Current Focus (The "Now")

We are currently running live market tests with specific pilot clients to validate value and optimize conversion.

**Active Pilots:**
*   **Healing Emerald**
*   **FitRight**

**Immediate Objective:**
*   Drive traffic to their **Program Pages**.
*   **Optimize Conversion Rates** on these pages.
*   Gather learning data from real user behavior.

## 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

These are the metrics that matter right now. All engineering efforts must move these needles.

*   **Primary Metric**: Program Page Conversion Rate (Visitors -> Enrolled/Sign-ups).
*   **North Star (Next 30 Days)**: Onboard **10 New Tenants**.

## 3. Engineering Guidelines (The "How")

1.  **Check Alignment**: Before writing code, ask: "Does this help us convert traffic for Healing Emerald/FitRight, or help us get the next 10 tenants?"
2.  **Manual Over Auto**: Do not build an event system if we can do it manually. Do not build a complex admin panel if a JSON edit suffices.
3.  **Speed**: We need to iterate fast based on feedback from the pilots.

## 4. Vision

To build a data-driven platform that empowers organizations (tenants) to share knowledge effectively, validated step-by-step through real market usage.
