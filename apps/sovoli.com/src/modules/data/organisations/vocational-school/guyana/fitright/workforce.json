      "bio": "Xavrine, the creator behind Fitright Sewing and Teaching, is a long-time educator with a passion for sewing that began in the early 1970s. Over the years, that passion turned into a profession. She opened a private Sewing Studio to serve individuals both here in Guyana and overseas. Her work has ranged from simple clothing to wedding ensembles. With decades of hands-on experience in teaching and as a graduate of The Fashion Institute of Technology (New York), she is excited to share everything she has learned—from making a tote bag to constructing full garments.",
