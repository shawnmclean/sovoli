    content: `I’m a parent of the school, my son attends Modern Academy. If you’re about to start your child off at preschool this is the perfect school to begin with, especially if you’re an overprotective and skeptical mom like I am. You’ll find welcoming and kind teachers there to leave your babies with — very professional and kind. They prioritize your kids and take great care of them so you can rest assured they are safe and comfortable. I highly recommend their great services. I was not disappointed — my son started off since in preschool and he’s now moving onto grade 2 in the new term with Modern Academy.`,
