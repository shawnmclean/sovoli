      "description": "Overview\nHurricane Melissa caused extensive structural, environmental, and operational damage to the Jabneh Christian Academy compound. The storm severely affected classroom spaces, teaching resources, and the safety of the surrounding property\nDescription of Damages\n1. Collapsed Building\nOne of the school's two main buildings completely collapsed during the hurricane. This building served Grades 1 to 3 icons and contained a 20 x 40 multipurpose room used for indoor physical education, graduation ceremonies, rest periods, and other gatherings.\nLosses from the collapse include:\n•\tTwo (2) air conditioning units\n•\tOne (1) television\n•\tOne (1) standing fan\n•\tThree wall fans\n•\tOne (1) table tennis table\n•\t student desks and chairs\n•\tBooks, textbooks, and teaching-learning materials\n2. Second Building\nThe second building sustained moderate interior and structural damage, including:\n•\t broken windows\n•\tThe partition separating the office and the classroom was blown down\n•\tThe canteen roof was lifted, causing significant leakage during rainfall\n3. Fence and Surrounding Areas\nThe storm caused widespread destruction across the compound's external environment:\n•\tMultiple trees were uprooted, removing the shade that previously supported outdoor learning and play.\n•\tA mango tree fell on the fence near the car park, damaging that section.\n•\tA coconut tree fell on the rear fence, compromising another section of the perimeter.\n•\tAs a result, the school's fence sustained several breaches and significant structural damage, reducing property security.\n4. Utilities and Infrastructure\n•\tWater has been restored.\n•\tElectricity remains disconnected.\n•\tA utility pole on the property is leaning and on its way down, posing an ongoing safety concern and requiring urgent attention.\n•\tDebris clearing and site cleaning continue daily to ensure the compound becomes safe for reoccupation.",
