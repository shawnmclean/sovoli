This is a living document for getting the platform ranked up on search results.

## Problem

Even after submitting sitemaps and setting up google search console, and optimizing load times, some pages are not being indexed.

Getting indexed and ranked up is a science, so I am documenting the process as I go along.

## Web Performance

Search Engine Journal mentions that loading performance matters. Especially on mobile device as they have mobile-first indexing. Our Posthog landing page report shows that we're around 60% mobile visitors.

### Tools

More than one analytics tool is recommended so we can correlate data. Complete trust in one man's tool can lead to poor data integrity. So we will setup the following based on our NextJs stack:

Vercel Web Analytics - here

PostHog - they support product and web analytics plus web vitals

Other tools that are not installed:

- Google PageSpeed Insights - here
- WebPageTest - here
- Lighthouse for local development - chrome web store
### Method

Web Vital tools like Vercel, PostHog and PageSpeed Insights will give us guidelines.

The analytics tools will show us data from real user samples, so fixing issues may take some time to show up, but PageSpeed Insights can be used to test immediate changes.
