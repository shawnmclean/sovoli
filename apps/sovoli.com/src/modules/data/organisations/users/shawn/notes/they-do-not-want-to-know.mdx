Someone on Reddit who made an account to correct misinformation about a disease they had, messaged me this.

They sound like they really know their stuff too.

They do the kind of research I would do and they’re talking sense when I looked at their history.

This is the second time I heard this statement from a knowledgeable person. The conversation was along the lines of how folks are using science to tell a one sided story. Especially a story about diseases being genetic.

This makes people feel helpless.

But it seems those people want to be helpless.

I’ve come across folks complaining about their problems and when pointed to a solution, they find all the excuse they can to say why they will remain in that situation. 

The first time I heard this was from Alan. His response was to my statement about folks going around in circles with their problems.

How is it that I am not in the field of biology, but yet it took me about 2 years of working on myself to find out that health is not all about biochemistry? That there is something more to the problem.

There is always something more to the problem as it relates to humans.

But for those who have figured out the next step and advanced their level, sometimes they will visit the previous levels to help the noobs advance too. And this is where we come across this mentality.

Each level is a community of folks who have mastered it so well that they would rather play it over and over again. They do not want to go to the next level because it is uncomfortable. There will be massive effort required to learn.

Sometimes they have to forget what they knew in the previous levels and start over.

It is like the guys studying classical physics and then they learn about quantum physics. The previous rules do not apply here.

Should I continue to help people or continue advancing on my own?

Sure I will get there faster but when you have more advanced people beside you, you capture a wider surface area and therefore build resiliency and cover more distance.

When I play online video games, like RuneScape, I will go back to the starting areas to help out a few folks.

I will continue going back to the previous levels and help those willing to advance themselves.

Not everyone will get there, but the one or two that levels up will be a major win in the game of life as we know it.
