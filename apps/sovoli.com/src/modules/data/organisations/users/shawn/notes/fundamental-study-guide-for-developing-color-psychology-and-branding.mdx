### Synthesis and Application
After studying these seminal works, synthesize your findings:

1. Develop Your Testing Framework:
- Based on Bernays' and Overstreet’s work, create hypotheses about how specific colors will influence your audience's behavior.
- Use Kahneman’s ideas to develop A/B tests focusing on fast vs. slow decision-making in relation to color.

2. Design Experiments and Refine the Brand:
- Develop tests using different colors for CTA buttons, headers, and key visuals on your website and social media.
- Track engagement rates, click-throughs, and user feedback to measure effectiveness.

3. Iterate Based on Emotional and Symbolic Insights:
- Refine your color choices based on the emotional resonance (Goleman) and symbolic meaning (Jung).
- Continue testing and tweaking until your color scheme aligns with Sovoli’s brand identity.
