> This is the “only” way

This is a statement where my mind goes on high alert, awaiting more information from the person to make a judgement call on their open mindedness.

But while reading the magic of believing, I came across it used in a situation where it might just be applicable.

> the only way you can demonstrate it is to try it yourself
>

This resonates to me because I was taught very early that to claim you know something, you have to observe it for yourself and test it for yourself.

Book knowledge is one way to “know” something but you really don’t “know” it unless you have direct first hand experience. Their observations and methods of testing may not apply to you in your context.

It might not work in your environment, on your team, for your company and business, or for your own body.

## What is healthy for you may be poison for me

Similarly to observations and testing done on diets will give different outcomes based on the time of year and location of the individual on the planet. A carnivorous and low carb diet might work for the Americans who face winter months, but it can give drastically different results for those in the tropics where anomalies show up in blood work.

We are told the Mediterranean diet makes humans live longer. So when we start on our health journeys we switch to olive oil and the sort of foods found from the Mediterranean, which we will purchase in supermarkets that is imported from that region.

Even when olives does not grow in our region, or we don’t have those type of nuts, rice or vegetables. None of this eating makes any sense. Just as how it makes no sense for the Canadian to be consuming coconut oils from the tropics in winter. Where does any of the food match up with the environment when we import it?

The science of the white northern men may not be applicable to the black tropical women.

We call nutrition science a joke, which is typically referred to as “ideology”. The low carb science as the white man’s science. Which is most of science anyways as most of the research is conducted by them.

Those who do not understand it, but sees all the advancement that science and technology has brought us, will start holding the belief that “science” knows it all and it is the only way to know something. It’s not about the scientific method, but it is more about the belief system of science, which is referred to as “scientism”.

So they hold the belief that science is the only way to know how man should eat and live. It is the only way to determine what we should put in and on our bodies.

Many will not even do anything by intuition anymore, they will eat, breathe, exercise, drink, have sex scientifically. And if there is no evidence for a way of living, well it means we should not live that way.

The only way to live is the way of science.

## Your business is not my business

We see this same mentality infecting our teams and businesses.

> This is how it has always been done
> 
> 

Seems to be a statement used to keep the status quo and prevent change and growth. The way it has been done got us to that level but may not get us to the next level.

This is why many teams and people are stuck. They are stuck in a loop doing the same thing over and over because that is what they observed and know. Sometimes they have not experienced anything for themselves but some other man on the internet told them this is the way it is done.

What may have worked on your previous team or company may not work in this one. What worked yesterday may not work today.

The most successful companies held experimentation as a core belief. One must believe in change. Try and test new things for yourself, see what works or doesn’t work. This mindset has gotten these companies acquired.

> This is not how companies do things
> 
> 

Now I’ve seen the complete opposite of this mindset in companies that caused the company total catastrophe. Nothing new cannot be tested or done, because the belief was tightly coupled to methods.

Whomever placed the belief that, did it in such a way that the holder of that belief would sabotage the alternative method subconsciously.

> I don’t believe it will work but let’s still try it
> 
> 

This is a slightly different variation of the same closed minded beliefs. If one does not believe in the thing, and holds a strong belief in the alternative way, then that man will sabotage the new way being tested.

I’ve seen this in companies, small businesses, farming, from mechanics and all walks of life.

The deeply held belief controls the subconscious and that subconscious will do whatever it can to not make it work. So it can feel it is right. Whatever power it derives from being right and elevate itself over the other person seems to be something the psychologists can talk about as it relates to “ego”.

The conscious man can see these behaviors while the unconscious cannot fathom that is what they are doing unless you find a way to question them. Even the questions make them very uncomfortable.

Some beliefs are held in such a way where it is instilled there by another man externally, and someone else will also have evidence why that belief may not work. But the one who holds the belief will not see it, even if it is right Infront of them.

They are unable to even observe and test it for themselves.

## The only way it works

> The only way is to demonstrate certain things is if you test it yourself 
> 
> 

This is now a belief I can work with. It was how I have always operated and it has served me well. 

Until I come across another use of this reductionistic term called “only”, any other usage will cause my judgement senses to go on alert.
