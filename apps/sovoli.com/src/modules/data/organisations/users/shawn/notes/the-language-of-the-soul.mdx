As the human mind becomes more tuned, its use of language to think and communicate begins to change. 

This language will be unrecognizable by the ones not yet initiated. This initiation requires the sender and the receiver to be **entrained** into similar methods of processing. Just as how cellphones cannot process radio waves emitted from radio towers. Both must have hardware and software compatibility to send and receive.

Language becomes frequency. 

Our communication is no longer about meaning, but resonance. 

How it makes us feel, not emotionally, but energetically; energy in motion.

## Entrainment and Mental Attunement

Psychologists would tell us that most communication is nonverbal - body language, posture, tone.

But yet the psychologists who study physics will tell you that another form of transmission is electromagnetic in nature.

All of this comes down to frequencies:

- Photonic exchange - light, both visible and invisible
- Electromagnetic fields - radiating energy fields
- Atomic transmission - dense molecular interactions, such as food, water and air
- Electrical transmission - charged particle flow expressed as voltage and current
- Thermal transmission - kinetic molecular vibrations expressed as temperature
- Accoustic transmission - air pressure molecular vibrations expressed as sound
- Tactile transmission - solid body molecular vibrations expressed as touch and pressure
- Olfactory transmission - volatile molecular vibrations expressed as smell
- Gravitational transmission - dense body forces, lunar, solar, earth and others
- Unamed Forces - fields we've yet to measure with current instruments
All of which is considered energy in the realm of physics.

Computer scientists will tell you that every system has input, processing and output. The processing is derived from what the input and output should be. 

In Machine Intelligence systems, this processing is continuously evolving based on input and output validation feedback loops.

Entrainment, then, is the alignment of processing due to getting the right inputs into the system.

So since we have determined that inputs and outputs take many forms, and the physicists shows us how energy transforms from one state to the other, then we can deduce that:

## Silence and Nature

Therefore, true communication is crafted in silence. 

Not auditory silence, but signal amplification by removing noise.

It is crafted from taking **walks**.

It forms during **meditations**.

Both are one and of the same, retraining of the system's input by reconnecting with the source environment: **nature**.

Which in our modern world, that simply means **going outside**.

The natural cycles - light, darkness, stars, moon, sun, trees, birds, water, temperatures, flora, fauna, will force the emptying of the mind by re-tuning the body to its original rythms. 

This resets internal communications at every level:

- cellular-cellular
- mind-body
- mind-divine

## Words as Transmission Signals 

Every word that is generated by synchronized environmental signals will carry massive energetic weight and high-fidelity information.

These words do not arrive softly. 

They arrive with force. 

A force that can bypasses:

- Surface level beliefs
- Doctrines
- Social programming
- Ego constructs
We are able to target deeper psychology of the mind with words the soul remembers.

This means we target the layer that no other human can unwind with false teachings. 

It will be a seed that is watered through experience.

No matter the environment, they will remember the signal those words carried for the rest of their lives.

## Soul Reception

A well-tuned signal producer. Will tune the receiver, regardless of its environment. Like tuning forks. The signal may remain dormant for months, years and decades until a forcing function arrives.

This forcing function can be due to emotional turbulences:

- Health issues
- Death of loved ones
- Break ups
- Ego Deaths
When this arrives, the soul will surface the signal.

It will arrive as intuition and gut feeling. A feeling of the nervous system activating. Then the thoughts will back the feeling. It is the feeling that must come first, not the thought. 

Thoughts can be generated internally (personal or ancestral memory), or from the environment. The thought can be produced from other means, which is why some scientist would say "It came to me in a dream".

This is where a tuned signal processor comes in to discern source of thought.

Then they may pull up an old book that was suggested to them, an old text message, email or letter. Or just simply the words burnt in memory. To seek understanding.

So what is the activation force of the soul? What is this "other means" for the source of thought?

## Holy Texts

This is why holy texts such as the Bible constantly talks about "The Word".

The signals of higher order concious minds transmit signals in ways that spans generations when written down.

The dons of them - Jesus, Moses, Paul, Siddartha - retreated from the noise and spent time alone in nature to receive and transmit those signals.

You can read their work and not understand it. 

This is why these texts are accompanied by suggestions to **meditate**, **pray** or **fast** - to clear noise so signal can be received.

This method for elevation of understanding has been known since humans have started documenting its history.

Jesus was documented in Mark 1:35 to be leaving the house before sunrise to go **outside** to find a quiet place to **pray** and **meditate**. These guys understood biology more than the modern scientific man.

This is why they all talk about some kind of higher order power. Because they were able to hear it by reducing noise and improving celestial body synchronization.

Words can activate the soul to hear the signals from that driving force. If it comes from those with the ability to hear the signals themselves.

The high signal words will sink in like music rather than read like a textbook.

> The ego hears language as sound
> 
> The mind hears it as meaning
> 
> The soul hears it as signal
> 
> 

When the environment is right, the signal awakens what was seeded long ago.

Nature is King.
