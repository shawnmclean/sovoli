> I’m researching rhythms and cycles.
>
> I’m trying to create a planning system that I can use to achieve a certain goal.
>
> For example, I’d like to build up a certain body strength, flexibility and muscle mass.
>
> I want to ensure this is part of a lifestyle that also works with my professional and spiritual life. So this will dictate when I work and how.
>
> My experience is that I can set a goal and use sheer force of will and discipline to stick to these goals.
>
> However, I’ve also found that it is much easier to work with the environment and the body’s own natural cycles, which can reduce the requirement for will power.
>
> So instead of planning around man-made timing concepts such as seconds, minutes, hours, 24 hours, weeks, and months, I’d prefer to work with what I know.
>
> Or rather, what my cells know since life arrived on the planet.
>
> This means a few objectives and its movements.
>
> The Earth, Sun, Moon, and the other planets.
>
> We have the rotation of the Earth on its axis.
>
> The primary signals we get for this is from the Sun and depending on the location on the planet, the light composition will differ as we rotate.
>
> We also have the Moon that does the same thing.
>
> The signals for this is from the light and gravitational pull.
>
> So for the Earth and Sun, we have a day/night cycle called circadian and a full rotation cycle called circannual.
>
> The Moon rotates a bit differently as the same side is always towards Earth.
>
> So do we have a full rotation around the Earth as a rhythm? What is the lunar cycle?
>
> Then we have to factor in all 3 objects together.
>
> There are cycles between the Sun, Earth, and Moon. So sometimes we will see a full moon vs half moon, etc.
>
> What are the cyclical patterns here?
>
> We will leave off the other planets for now and work with these 3 objects together to detect all observable cyclical patterns and derive the rhythms our cells may be using as signals to change behavior.
>
> We will draw on Western and Eastern sciences from planetary sciences and other biological sciences such as photobiology and biochemistry to ancient Chinese, Egyptian, and other teachings.
