# My Study Notes

This is my personal collection of programming study notes.

## React Hooks

React hooks are a way to use state and other React features in functional components.

### useState

The useState hook allows you to add state to functional components.

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

## TypeScript Tips

TypeScript provides static type checking for JavaScript.

### Interface vs Type

- Use `interface` for object shapes that might be extended
- Use `type` for unions, primitives, and computed types

## Next.js Best Practices

Next.js is a React framework that provides additional features like server-side rendering.

### App Router vs Pages Router

- **App Router**: New routing system with layouts and nested routes
- **Pages Router**: Traditional file-based routing system
