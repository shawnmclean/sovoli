In *Dark Psychology* by William and *The Power of Now* by Eckhart Tolle, both authors explore how individuals may remain in a state of depression through different psychological mechanisms. *Dark Psychology* introduces the concept of the "victimhood mentality," where individuals subconsciously use their suffering to attract emotional attention and validation. This attention reinforces their feeling of importance and can become a barrier to healing, trapping them in a depressive state.

*Tolle’s* approach in *The Power of Now* focuses on how the ego attaches itself to suffering. According to him, the ego thrives on identifying with pain and past trauma because it provides a stable sense of self. This attachment makes it difficult to let go of the suffering, as the individual feels their pain is a core part of their identity.

### Contrasting Perspectives on Why People Stay in Pain

- *Dark Psychology*: People may remain in depression because of emotional benefits, such as receiving attention and validation from others, reinforcing their sense of importance.
- *The Power of Now*: Individuals may stay depressed because their ego has fused with their suffering, making it hard to let go, as pain becomes part of their identity.

### Covert vs. Overt Depression: Are People Deliberately Staying Depressed for Attention?

Just as narcissism can be divided into covert and overt forms, there are also ways to distinguish between covert and overt depression. While not formal diagnostic categories, these patterns reflect how individuals express depressive symptoms differently, sometimes openly (overt) and sometimes hidden (covert). The distinction can help us understand why some people may seem to remain in a state of depression for attention.

#### Overt Depression ("Externalizing Depression")
- **Characteristics**: This form of depression is more visible, with individuals openly expressing their suffering to others. They may seek emotional validation, help, or support and are often outwardly sad, withdrawn, or struggling. Overt depression is easier to recognize because the signs are more obvious.
- **Manipulation Potential**: In certain cases, overt depression may involve attention-seeking behavior, where the individual receives validation or sympathy for their struggles. This doesn’t mean they are "faking" their depression, but there could be an unconscious use of their suffering to gain emotional care from others.

#### Covert Depression ("Smiling Depression" or "Internalizing Depression")
- **Characteristics**: In contrast, covert depression is often hidden from others. People with covert depression may appear to function normally, masking their inner turmoil behind a facade of happiness or competence. They may avoid sharing their pain and are often reluctant to seek help. Covert depression can be difficult to detect because the person is not openly expressing their struggles.
- **Ego Attachment**: This aligns with *The Power of Now*'s concept of ego attachment, where people may hold onto their pain internally, even if they don't seek external validation. Their suffering is often more about an internal battle than manipulation.

### Distinguishing Between Attention-Seeking Depression and Genuine Depression

While both overt and covert depression involve real suffering, certain patterns can help distinguish between individuals who may be unconsciously seeking attention through their depressive state and those dealing with genuine, debilitating depression:

1. **Avoidance of Improvement**: Those who remain in depression for attention might resist therapeutic efforts or actively avoid taking steps toward healing, as their depressive state provides emotional validation. In contrast, individuals with real depression often want to improve but struggle to take action due to their condition.

2. **Response to Support**: Attention-seeking individuals may continuously seek emotional support without making any effort to implement advice, whereas those with genuine depression may appreciate help but feel guilty about burdening others.

3. **Consistency of Symptoms**: In attention-seeking behavior, depressive symptoms may appear selectively (e.g., in social settings or around certain individuals). Genuine depression is more consistent, affecting all areas of life regardless of external attention.

4. **Emotional Dependency**: Emotional manipulation may manifest as an over-reliance on others for care and attention, using guilt or pressure to keep others involved. In real depression, individuals often feel uncomfortable asking for help and may isolate themselves due to guilt.

5. **Sense of Identity**: In attention-seeking depression, individuals might tie their identity to their suffering and fear losing their "role" as the one who needs help. Genuine depression, on the other hand, leaves individuals longing for a return to their previous, healthier selves.

### Professional Guidance

It’s crucial to recognize that depression, whether overt or covert, involves real suffering. Careful consideration and empathy are needed to avoid invalidating someone's experience. Mental health professionals are best equipped to assess whether someone’s behavior involves emotional manipulation or is part of a genuine mental health condition.
