### 1. Jesus and Judas: Betrayal as a Case Study in Narcissism and Unconscious Behavior

**Primary Bible Reading**:
- **Matthew 26:14-16, 20-25, 47-50** – Judas’ betrayal of Jesus.
- **John 13:2-30** – Satan’s influence over Judas and his betrayal during the Last Supper.
- **Luke 22:3-6, 47-48** – How Judas was swayed, emotionally and spiritually, to betray Jesus.

**Discussion Points**:
- Was Judas acting out of conscious intent, or was he a pawn in a larger, unconscious plan?
- How does Judas’ betrayal reflect the traits of narcissism, such as grandiosity, lack of empathy, and selfishness? Did Judas rationalize his behavior as serving a larger purpose, similar to how narcissists often justify their manipulation?

**Connections to Modern Psychology**:
- Judas' betrayal can be analyzed through the lens of Cluster B personality disorders (which include Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Antisocial Personality Disorder).
- **Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)** is characterized by a sense of entitlement, manipulation, and lack of empathy. Judas' betrayal could be seen as driven by narcissistic traits—seeking personal gain, validation, or power through association with the powerful religious leaders.

**Reflection**:
- **Was Judas unconscious?** The Bible suggests that Satan influenced him, symbolizing how people can act out of alignment with their true selves, driven by external influences, societal pressure, or personal gain. In this sense, Judas may not have been fully conscious of the depth of his betrayal or its spiritual consequences.
- Can Judas’ actions be seen as a reflection of narcissistic behavior—being unable to connect to the true consequences of one's actions due to a self-centered, unconscious perspective?

### 2. Unconsciousness: Biblical and Psychological Perspectives

**Primary Bible Reading**:
- **Romans 7:14-24** – Paul’s inner conflict, representing the unconscious struggle between doing what is right and succumbing to sin. This internal struggle mirrors the spiritual unconsciousness in the modern sense of lacking self-awareness.
- **Matthew 23:25-28** – Jesus condemns the Pharisees for their hypocrisy, a behavior often driven by a lack of conscious self-awareness, concerned more with outward appearances than inner truth.

**Supplementary Reading**:
- **The Power of Now** by Eckhart Tolle – Tolle’s concepts of unconscious behavior and the “pain-body” can help understand why people, including Judas, act in destructive ways. Tolle describes unconsciousness as being trapped in patterns of pain and reactivity, much like how Judas may have been trapped in a spiritual and psychological state of unconsciousness.
  
**Reflection**:
- In the same way that Judas may have been unconscious of the true weight of his actions, modern psychology suggests that people with narcissistic traits or other Cluster B disorders may act unconsciously, driven by a need for validation and a lack of self-awareness. This lack of awareness disconnects them from the impact of their actions on others.

### 3. Narcissism, Triangulation, and Manipulation in the Bible

**Primary Bible Reading**:
- **1 Kings 21** – The story of Ahab and Jezebel, where Jezebel’s manipulation and lies lead to Naboth’s death. This is a classic case of triangulation, where Jezebel manipulates others for her personal gain.
- **Matthew 23:1-12** – Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for their hypocritical behavior, seeking admiration and validation, much like how narcissists seek attention while manipulating others.

**Connections to Narcissism**:
- **Triangulation and Smear Campaigns**: These tactics are commonly used by people with narcissistic tendencies to manipulate and control others. In 1 Kings 21, Jezebel uses manipulation and false accusations (smear campaign) to achieve her goals. Judas, similarly, betrays Jesus, and the Pharisees manipulate public opinion against Him. This mirrors the techniques of triangulation, where others are drawn into conflict to shift power dynamics.

### 4. Jesus’ Response to Betrayal and Narcissism

**Primary Bible Reading**:
- **Matthew 5:43-48** – Jesus teaches about loving your enemies and praying for those who persecute you. His response to betrayal is one of compassion, rather than retaliation, which contrasts with the narcissistic need to control or harm others in response to perceived slights.
- **Luke 23:34** – Jesus’ forgiveness of those who crucified Him, exemplifying a consciousness rooted in love, presence, and understanding, rather than reactive anger.
