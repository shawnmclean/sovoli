> "If you keep your attention in the body as much as possible, you will be anchored in the Now. You won’t lose yourself in the external world, and you won’t lose yourself in your mind. Thoughts and emotions, fears and desires, may still be there to some extent, but they won’t take you over."  
> – Eckhart Tolle

## My Thoughts

My experience with focusing on the body reveals that the mind can sync to a natural rhythm. It’s easier to achieve the present state that Eckhart describes when I focus on simple actions like breathing or walking. The key isn’t about trying to control these activities but rather observing and listening to what the body does autonomously.

For instance, walking along the beach, one can feel how the foot muscles stabilize without conscious control, a skill the body developed innately from infancy. Similarly, breathing is an involuntary process, yet it adjusts with our surroundings—slowing in a cold room or speeding up in a sauna.

Eckhart suggests that conscious focus can energize the body’s cells, akin to how we can activate muscles. This brings up an intriguing question: Is there a deeper energy exchange at play? When we listen attentively to someone speak, are we not only receiving their emotional energy but also giving something back? 

Perhaps this explains why being genuinely listened to feels so powerful. It’s more than absorbing words; it’s an energetic loop. The body and mind may operate on similar feedback systems, gaining energy from the act of being heard, and even more so when needs like hunger or thirst are met based on specific bodily cues.

Listening to the body, as Eckhart emphasizes, helps us transcend the mental chatter and connect to a more profound sense of being.
