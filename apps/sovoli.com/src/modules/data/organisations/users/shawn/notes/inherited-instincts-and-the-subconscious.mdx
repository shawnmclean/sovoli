There is no nature vs nurture, there is nature and nurture. Behavior is both learnt and inherited. We can see this with the body as certain behaviors such as walking, vocal chord manipulation and other mechanical systems are activated before the brain has a chance to pull up that information and “think” it through.

This behavior is studied by the psychologists and neuroscience to the point where they are able to trace the information movements between the Amydala back to the nervous system and muscles before the rest of the cognitive functions are able to process and react with thought.

The instinct takes over.

Since we separate this behavior at each level, from muscle memory to nervous system response to cognitive conscious response, to subconscious response, then it makes sense that each layer is primed with ancestral information.

This is why guys like Dwayne will say we “know” everything already. Others call it “the Universal Mind”, others “God”. It is the knowledge bank of all things that every ancestor has experienced.

We could follow this up to the first life form coming down to all branches of evolution. We are cut from the same “cloth” but divergence determines what we may or may not have access to.

There is a concept called horizontal gene transfer. This can be done through direct manipulation of the DNA molecules by another molecule (see virus replication) and electromagnetic fields (see water experiments).

So maybe we do know “everything”, that is even outside of the direct ancestral lineage.

We don’t only know the photon that hits our grandmother’s skin, transferring energy that disseminates through the entire system (vibrations, biophotons, changing of bonds, etc), but we may have access to the photon information that hit her friends that she spent time with.

And information those who spends time with that friend and so on.

This is why they talk about you are the sum of the people you surround yourself with.

These information and beliefs are transferred at every level for the organism to survive its environment.

This version of the mind will access this knowledge to come up with solutions that guides the conscious mind.

Should we really trust it? Can it not be overridden?

Can the ancestor not be fooled into believing something that may be correct, just enough to create an offspring so that knowledge and behavior is retained as a success?

What is repetition really doing? It’s dealing with the conscious mind but is it doing anything to the subconscious?

Maybe it’s not just conscious and subconscious.

But there is a third component.

There will always be a third component. We will figure out the subconscious, or part of it and carve that up as a new layer. As what the psychologists are doing, such as the Freuds and Bernays. Who seemed to have figured out how to fool the subconscious.

So whatever this layer is called, there will be another layer that will know the truth.

Maybe this is what the subconscious talks to?

Thoughts/Feelings (conscious) > instincts (subconscious) > third component?
