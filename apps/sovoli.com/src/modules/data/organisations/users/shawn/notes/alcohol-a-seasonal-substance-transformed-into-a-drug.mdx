**Thought**:  
Alcohol is a drug.

I classify a drug as anything isolated from nature and consumed in quantities not naturally available for nutritional purposes.

This includes substances like marijuana, tobacco, alcohol, psychedelics, and refined ingredients like sugar, stevia, or dairy cream used in ice creams. Alcohol, found in limited quantities through the natural fermentation of fruits and grains, is inherently seasonal, appearing only briefly when conditions support fermentation. Historically, alcohol consumption aligned with harvest cycles, presenting in low concentrations and only for brief periods of the year.

### Analysis

1. **Impact on the Mind**:  
   Alcohol’s effect on the mind is due to its impact on neurotransmitters, primarily GABA. By binding to GABA receptors, alcohol slows down brain function, contributing to feelings of relaxation, drowsiness, and reduced inhibition. This can initially create a mild sense of focus or relaxation, but as alcohol’s effects deepen, it slows cognition, making it harder to maintain mental clarity or reaction time.

   There’s a popular concept known as the "Ballmer Peak," which suggests that a specific range of blood alcohol content (approximately 0.07-0.13%) can temporarily enhance cognitive performance, particularly in problem-solving tasks. I experimented with this idea, hoping to find a boost in focus or clarity during certain tasks. However, in my experience, it didn’t work as expected; any initial focus faded quickly, giving way to the familiar fall-off where my mind felt sluggish and less sharp.

   While some may experience a brief window of enhanced focus, this effect was fleeting for me. Alcohol typically reduces cognitive performance over time, making tasks requiring sustained concentration more difficult as its impact on the nervous system intensifies.

2. **Liver Processing and Enzyme Elevation**:  
   When consumed in significant quantities, alcohol places a heavy burden on the liver, the primary organ responsible for processing it. The liver metabolizes alcohol by converting it into acetaldehyde, a toxic substance, which is then broken down further. However, this process can strain the liver, leading to elevated levels of liver enzymes, including AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase), markers that indicate liver stress or damage.

   I experienced this effect firsthand when drinking port wine regularly, averaging around three bottles a week. My lab tests showed a noticeable increase in both AST and ALT levels, suggesting my liver was working harder than normal to process the high levels of alcohol and sugar. Port wine, with its combination of high sugar and alcohol, requires substantial liver processing, illustrating the risks of consuming fortified wines and similar concentrated forms that exceed what the liver would typically encounter in nature.

3. **Glucose Metabolism and HbA1c**:  
   Alcohol’s effects extend to glucose metabolism, even when liver enzymes and fasting glucose remain stable. For instance, while drinking 1 liter of 40% rum weekly did not raise my AST or ALT levels, my HbA1c still increased, going from 5.3% to 6.5%. HbA1c reflects average blood glucose over several months, and an increase in this measure may suggest changes in glucose stability or longer-term blood sugar exposure, even if fasting glucose and insulin levels remain within a healthy range. Additionally, my Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) at 2 hours was normal, indicating that immediate glucose regulation was not an issue.

   Despite the minimal carbohydrate content in hard liquors like rum, high alcohol intake can subtly impact blood sugar dynamics. This effect suggests that while immediate glucose regulation (as shown by fasting glucose and OGTT) was unaffected, chronic alcohol consumption may influence blood glucose averages over time. This change highlights alcohol’s potential to affect glucose metabolism beyond the typical markers of insulin resistance, especially with regular, concentrated intake.

4. **Natural and Seasonal Drinking**:  
   Traditionally, alcohol was only available in low concentrations, aligning with seasonal harvests when fruits and grains would ferment naturally. Wines, beers, and other mildly alcoholic drinks were a product of these harvest cycles, with natural fermentation yielding alcohol levels that were balanced and fleeting. 

   For example, in Jamaica, fruits like bananas are available year-round, making it possible to produce fruit wines like banana wine continuously. However, drinking based on seasonal availability rather than constant consumption helps keep alcohol in balance with natural rhythms. This practice aligns with small-scale farming and natural growth cycles, where fermentation reflects the seasonal excesses and specific times of year when fruits are abundant. Drinking in tune with these cycles supports moderation and maintains the connection to alcohol’s natural origins.

5. **Breaking the Addiction Cycle**:  
   Alcohol can become addictive, especially when used as a way to cope with emotional disturbances or stress. I found myself gravitating toward alcohol as a way to manage emotions during difficult times, and breaking this cycle required a firm commitment. To overcome this pattern, I wrote a “psychological contract” with myself, pledging to abstain from alcohol for three months.

   This contract wasn’t just a promise; it included detailed reasons for abstaining, such as using the break as a health experiment to observe potential changes in lab results, like AST, ALT, and HbA1c levels. The contract served as a personal test of self-respect. If I couldn’t uphold a private agreement with myself, how could I expect to uphold commitments with others, such as business contracts? By establishing this inner accountability, I was able to create a structure to break the habitual pull of alcohol and replace it with healthier coping mechanisms.

In essence, while alcohol in its natural form is mild and seasonally available, modern processing and year-round access have transformed it into a potent, ubiquitous substance. This shift has amplified alcohol’s impact on the brain, liver, and metabolism, marking a departure from its seasonal, low-potency origins.
