There is a deep, almost instinctual connection between humans and water. We build hotels on hills to overlook the ocean, create ponds and fountains for the calming sound of flowing water, and even animals, like dogs, seem to be drawn to waterâ€™s presence. This relationship suggests that the sight and sound of water have significant effects on the human mind, evoking peace, introspection, and awe. This phenomenon, often referred to as "blue mind," hints at water's ability to soothe and heal, both mentally and physically.
