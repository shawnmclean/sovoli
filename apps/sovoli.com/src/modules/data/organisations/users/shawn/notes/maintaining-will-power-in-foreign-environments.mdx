Since I will be traveling to Guyana and other countries, I need to ensure that their lifestyles do not negatively impact my way of life, but while striking a balance to ensure I am experiencing their way and adopting the beneficial aspects while dropping the rest.

## Core Values

To ensure health and high productivity, the following are important values to me:

- **Environmental Adaptation - Health**

- Natural Light
- Fresh Air
- Fresh Local Seasonal Food
- Walks and Exploration
- Sleep
- **Social and Cultural Adaptation - you = sum(people)**

- Meal and Alcohol Habits
- Physical Exercise Habits
- **Productivity - Work**

- Solitude
- Work
- Reading and Writing
The core principle of **Environmental Adaptation** is to give the body information of time and place within the universe.  This information helps us with predictability, and how we can prepare for the changes in the environment. This is one of the first principles of being at ease and dis-eases.

## Research

The following are areas of research that I need to conduct prior to visiting:

- **Accommodation:** Prioritizing natural light, ventilation, a kitchen for meal preparation, and a dedicated work area.
- **Food Source:** Where are the farmers' markets, butchers, fisheries, and dairy farmers?
- **Nature & Fitness:** Identifying spaces for walks, parks, trails, swimming, meditation, and gym access.
- **Social Settings:** Understanding the cultural normsâ€”Do they party a lot? Is alcohol consumption prevalent? Do people eat out frequently?
- **Health Products:** Finding sources for natural soaps, toothpaste, deodorants, and other personal care items.
Although research on these topics is mandatory, much of the discovery will happen on location. Online sources may be outdated or incomplete, so time must be dedicated to direct exploration. The research method will involve a combination of online resources, talking to locals, and firsthand investigation.

## Methodology

Upon arrival, I need to employ systematic protocols based on my core values.

### 1. Darkness & Sleep

The sun might be the primary source of energy but life is not all about energy. Energy is information, just as much as the lack of energy is information.

The first principles for this information is based primarily on the celestial cycles of the earth and sun. We call these patterns circadian and circannual rhythms.

Darkness is the most important part of this cycle in the modern world, therefore currently ranked highest as this is when we regenerate physically and psychologically.

**Ideal Approach**

- Its preferable to sleep after sunset or reduce exposure to artificial lights at night.
#### **Pros **

- **Environmental Adaptation - **darkness will enforce sleep and the internal day/night clocks. This helps the cells to tell some time. The length of the darkness may also tell position on the planet.
- **Psychological Regeneration - **along with the other benefits of sleep, we will process information from the days that will embed more information into our subconscious.
- **Physical Regeneration** - this is when the body cleans up, heals and grows. Even for muscle building, this is the period where fibres are repaired and we increase muscle mass.
#### **Cons & Challenges **

- **Social Pressure: **I usually need to give up socializing as people prefer to do that during the nights under artificial lighting environments.
#### **Balance** Strategy

- Limit night time activities to 2-3 nights per week.
- Wear clothes that cover up from artificial lights and blue light blockers.
- Leverage natural settings like bonfires for socializing. We had about 2 million years to adapt to fire.
### 2. Light & Exploration

Since the sun has different compositions at different time of day, the information will have to be sampled throughout the day. Especially sunrises and sunsets where we make the transition to and from darkness.

This period is when I will explore the environment as our ancestors did. A mixture of using modern technology such as maps to see what is in the surrounding areas. But most of the exploration will be done by free walking, which is going whereever the subconscious leads us.

> Walk without a care in the world - Alan Brown

**Ideal Approach:** 

- Walk every morning before sunrise or every afternoon to see sunset.
- Meditate beforehand to allow subconcious and higher power guidance.
- Leave all items behind (watch, money, etc)
#### Pros

- **Environmental Adaptation **- not just the benefits from exercise, but I will be soaking up the natural light and regional microbes from the environment. This allows the body to adapt better to the environment, using the principles of adaptive immunity.
- **Cognitive Boosts - **exploring new places forces the brain to process new and out of norm information, causing it to improve problem solving. I will be drawing inspiration from nature that also increases creativity. Observation skills are also being sharpened to improve decision-making and reaction times.
- **Resource Discovery - **I will end up finding fruit trees, markets, supermarkets and other areas to source good healthy food.
#### Cons & Challenges

- **Sleep Depreviation: **If I socialize in the nights, I will not wake early to go for walks.
- **Dangerous Environments:** Unfamiliar environments may pose risks of theft
#### Balance Strategy

- Go for walks 4-5 days per week and 1-2 times per day if possible.
- Take short walks during work and expose as much skin to the environment.
- Dress simply, carry minimal valuables and remain aware of surroundings
### 3. Food Sourcing

This is tied into exploration. Sourcing food includes alot of talking to people and observation of surroundings.

**Ideal Approach:** 

- Visit the farm directly, see how they treat the animals and plants.
- Question the farmers and hear how they view human health.
#### **Key Steps:**

- Locate and visit farmers' markets, butchers, and fisheries.
- Engage in conversations to identify the best local food sources.
- Sample and test different vendors for quality and freshness.
- Maintain a stock of fresh, seasonal, and nutrient-dense foods.
### 4. Personal Boundaries

Establishing personal boundaries is necessary to prevent lifestyle dilution due to external influences.

#### **Principles:**

- **Selective Socializing**: Engage with people who align with my values and lifestyle choices.
- **Dietary Discipline**: Avoid unnecessary indulgence in unhealthy foods.
- **Alcohol Moderation**: If drinking socially, choose clean alcohol sources and maintain limits.
- **Work & Solitude**: Protect personal time for reflection and productivity.
### 5. Work Mode

To maintain productivity, I have to ensure that certain protocols are followed for working.

#### **Best Practices:**

- **Structured Work Hours**: Maintain a set schedule that accounts for local adjustments.
- **Minimize Distractions**: Choose locations that support focus and deep work.
- **Leverage Local Resources**: Identify co-working spaces or libraries if necessary.
- **Balance Work & Exploration**: Alternate work sessions with short walks and environmental exposure.
## Summary

These strategies should allow me to alleviate energy required to maintain healthy lifestyle while traveling. The less energy required, the less will power is needed and therefore a routine/habit can be built within an extremely short timeframe.

The key to this success lies in pre-travel research, real-time adaptation and maintaining balance between social and cultural immersion and personal discpline.

The goal is not to avoid negative influences but to find a balance to integrate into the environment and adapt, while adopting the positive aspects to maintain holistic growth.
