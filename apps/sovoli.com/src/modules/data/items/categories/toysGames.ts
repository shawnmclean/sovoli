          gpcDescription: "Includes any products that can be described/observed as a powered educational toy designed to entertain and encourage learning by viewing changing scenes or patterns, mostly in 3D, through a viewing device or tube. The power source lights up the scenes being viewed. Some products are supplied with an infrared remote control that advances the picture reels to the next picture whenever the player is ready. The viewing device may be combined with a simple projector so that the images can be projected onto a wall or ceiling and some reels are sold with a sound cartridge that provides sound synchronised with the images being viewed.",
