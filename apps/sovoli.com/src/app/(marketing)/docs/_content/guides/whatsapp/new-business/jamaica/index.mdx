## Get a Business Phone Number

You need **one phone number only for the business**.

### Option 1: Buy a Physical SIM

1. Go to **GTT** or **Digicel**
2. Bring your ID
3. Buy a new SIM card
4. Activate it
5. Make sure it can receive calls and texts

### Option 2: Use an Existing Business Number

1. Make sure the number is active
2. It must not already be used on WhatsApp
3. Put the SIM in your phone

## Using an eSIM (No Physical SIM)

Some phones do not need a physical SIM card.  
They use something called an **eSIM**.

An eSIM lets you buy a phone number online and install it directly on your phone.

### Step 1: Check If Your Phone Supports eSIM

#### On iPhone
1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Cellular** or **Mobile Data**
3. If you see **Add eSIM**, your phone supports it

(Most iPhone XS, XR, and newer support eSIM)

#### On Android
1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Network & Internet**
3. Look for **SIMs**, **Mobile Network**, or **Add eSIM**

If you do not see eSIM options, your phone does **not** support eSIM.

### Step 2: Buy an eSIM Number

You can buy an eSIM online.

Make sure the eSIM:
- Can receive **SMS or phone calls**
- Works in **Guyana**
- Has **not been used with WhatsApp before**

You will receive:
- A QR code **or**
- An install link

### Step 3: Install the eSIM

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Cellular / Mobile Data**
3. Tap **Add eSIM**
4. Scan the QR code or open the install link
5. Wait for activation

Once installed, your phone now has a business number.

## Install & Set Up WhatsApp Business

Do everything below on **one phone first**.

1. Install **WhatsApp Business** from the App Store or Play Store
2. Open the app
3. Tap **Agree and Continue**
4. Enter your business phone number  
   (physical SIM or eSIM must already be active)
5. Country code for Guyana is **+592**
6. Confirm the number
7. Enter the 6-digit code sent by SMS or call
8. Skip backup (new account)
9. Enter your business name
10. Add a photo (optional)

You are now set up.
