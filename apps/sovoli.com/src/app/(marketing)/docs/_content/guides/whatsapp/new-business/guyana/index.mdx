You need **one number used only for the business**.

### Option 1: Buy a Physical SIM

1. Go to **GTT** or **Digicel**
2. Bring your ID
3. Buy and activate a SIM
4. Confirm it can receive calls and texts

### Option 2: Use an Existing Number

1. The number must be active
2. It must **not** already be on WhatsApp
3. Insert the SIM into your phone

## Using an eSIM (No Physical SIM)

Some phones do not need a physical SIM. They use an **eSIM**.

An eSIM is a phone number installed directly on the phone.

### Check if Your Phone Supports eSIM

**iPhone**
1. Settings → Cellular / Mobile Data
2. If you see **Add eSIM**, it’s supported  
   (iPhone XS / XR and newer)

**Android**
1. Settings → Network & Internet
2. Look for **SIMs**, **Mobile Network**, or **Add eSIM**

No eSIM option = not supported.

### Buy an eSIM

Make sure the eSIM:
- Can receive **SMS or calls**
- Works in **Guyana**
- Has **never been used on WhatsApp**

You’ll receive a **QR code or install link**.

### Install the eSIM

1. Settings → Cellular / Mobile Data
2. Tap **Add eSIM**
3. Scan the QR code or use the link
4. Wait for activation

Once done, the phone has a business number.

## Install & Set Up WhatsApp Business
