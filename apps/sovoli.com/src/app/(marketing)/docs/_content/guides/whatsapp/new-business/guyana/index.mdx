## Getting a New Business Number

You need a phone number that's only for your business. Here's how to get one in Guyana.

### Option 1: Buy a New SIM Card

1. Go to any GTT or Digicel store
2. Bring a valid ID (National ID or Passport)
3. Buy a new SIM card with a new number
4. Activate the SIM card at the store
5. Make sure the SIM card works in your phone before leaving

### Option 2: Use an Existing Business Number

If your business already has a phone number that's not being used for WhatsApp:

1. Make sure the number is active and can receive calls and texts
2. Remove the SIM card from any phone it's currently in
3. You'll use this number in the next steps

<Alert color="warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong> If this number was ever used with WhatsApp before, you may need to wait up to 7 days after removing it from the old device before you can use it again.

8. Tap "Next"
9. WhatsApp will send you a verification code via SMS

12. Once verified, you'll be asked to restore a backup. Tap "Skip" if this is a new account

  <strong>QR Code Warning:</strong> If you see a QR code screen, don't scan it yet. QR codes are for linking other devices, which we'll cover later. Close that screen and continue with phone number verification.
</Alert>

## Linking WhatsApp Business to Other Phones

You can use WhatsApp Business on multiple phones, but only one phone keeps the main number. Other phones link to it.

### Setting Up the Main Phone

The main phone is the one with your business SIM card:

1. Open WhatsApp Business on the phone with your business SIM card
2. Go to Settings (tap the three dots menu, then "Settings")
3. Tap "Linked Devices"
4. Tap "Link a Device"
5. You'll see a QR code on the screen

{/* Screenshot here: QR code screen on main phone */}

<Alert color="warning">
  <strong>QR Code Expires:</strong> QR codes expire after about 1 minute. If it expires, tap "Refresh" to get a new one. Make sure both phones are on the same Wi-Fi network or have good mobile data.
</Alert>

### Linking a Second Phone

On the phone you want to link:

<DeviceTabs
  androidContent={
    <ol>
      <li>Open WhatsApp Business on the second phone</li>
      <li>Tap "Agree and Continue"</li>
      <li>On the phone number screen, tap "Link to existing number" (at the bottom)</li>
      <li>You'll be asked to scan a QR code</li>
      <li>Tap "Scan QR Code"</li>
      <li>Point your phone's camera at the QR code on the main phone</li>
      <li>Wait for it to scan (you may need to allow camera permissions)</li>
      <li>The second phone will now be linked</li>
    </ol>
  }
  iosContent={
    <ol>
      <li>Open WhatsApp Business on the second phone</li>
      <li>Tap "Agree and Continue"</li>
      <li>On the phone number screen, tap "Link to existing number" (at the bottom)</li>
      <li>You'll be asked to scan a QR code</li>
      <li>Tap "Scan QR Code"</li>
      <li>Point your phone's camera at the QR code on the main phone</li>
      <li>Wait for it to scan (you may need to allow camera permissions)</li>
      <li>The second phone will now be linked</li>
    </ol>
  }
/>

The second phone can now send and receive messages for your business, but the main phone must stay connected to the internet for it to work.

## Using WhatsApp Business With a Team

If you want multiple people to use WhatsApp Business:

1. Link their phones following the steps above
2. Each linked phone can send and receive messages
3. All messages sync across all linked phones
4. Any team member can respond to customers

<Alert color="warning">
  <strong>Main Phone Must Stay On:</strong> The main phone (with the business SIM card) must stay turned on and connected to the internet. If it's off or loses internet, linked phones won't be able to send or receive messages.
</Alert>

### Managing Team Access

To see which devices are linked:

1. On the main phone, open WhatsApp Business
2. Go to Settings → Linked Devices
3. You'll see a list of all linked phones
4. To remove a device, tap on it and select "Unlink Device"

**Solutions:**
