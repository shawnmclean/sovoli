## Goals

This setup is designed to:

1. Use a **dedicated business number**, separate from personal WhatsApp.
2. Receive **local calls** from customers.
3. **Share WhatsApp access** with a team.
4. **Avoid a second phone** where possible by using a single device.

## Get a Business Phone Number

WhatsApp Business needs a **separate number** from your personal WhatsApp.

You have three options. We recommend **1 or 2**.

### Option 1: Same Phone (eSIM – Recommended)

Use an **eSIM** to add a second business number to the **same phone**.

- No second phone needed  
- Personal and business stay separate  

The next section explains this setup.


### Option 2: Purchase a Physical SIM

Use a **second phone** with a new SIM.

- Buy a SIM and activate the number
- Use this phone as the main business device


### Option 3: Convert Personal Number (Not Recommended)

Switching a personal number to WhatsApp Business is **not recommended**.

- Existing chats can be lost  
- Personal and business get mixed  

For growing businesses, start with a **new business number**.

---

## Using an eSIM (No Physical SIM)

An **eSIM** lets you add a second phone number to the **same phone** without a physical SIM.


### Check if Your Phone Supports eSIM

<DeviceTabs
  iosContent={
    <ol>
      <li>Settings → Cellular / Mobile Data</li>
      <li>
        If you see <strong>Add eSIM</strong>, it's supported  
        (iPhone XS / XR and newer)
      </li>
    </ol>
  }
  androidContent={
    <ol>
      <li>Settings → Network & Internet</li>
      <li>Look for <strong>SIMs</strong>, <strong>Mobile Network</strong>, or <strong>Add eSIM</strong></li>
    </ol>
  }
/>

No eSIM option = not supported.

### Buy an eSIM

**Recommended:** Visit a carrier store and ask a rep to set up an **eSIM** for you.

- Tell them you need a **new business number**
- Ask them to install it as an **eSIM**
- Confirm it can receive **calls and SMS**

This is the simplest and safest option.


**Optional: Do it yourself**

If you prefer, you can buy an eSIM online from a carrier’s website.

- Make sure it works in your country
- Buy the eSIM
- Activate it using the **QR code or install link**

Once activated, the number is ready for WhatsApp Business.
