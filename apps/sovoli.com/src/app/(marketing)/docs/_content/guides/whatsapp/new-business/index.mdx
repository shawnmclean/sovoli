## Getting the number

Choose a dedicated phone number that your business controls so verification and customer chats stay reliable.

## Downloading the app

Install WhatsApp Business from the official app store on the phone tied to that number and complete the verification flow.

## Sharing the account

Link additional devices from the primary phone so teammates can respond while keeping the main number active.
