# Business Verification Guide

Business verification increases trust on the marketplace and is **required** to enable Meta ads integration.

Without verification, ads that list your business as the **beneficiary or payer** may not be delivered in certain locations.

## Why Verify Your Business

Verification allows you to:

- Build trust with customers
- Run Meta ads using your business as the payer or beneficiary

---

## Accepted Documents

Use **official, unexpired documents** issued by the relevant authority.

Accepted documents:

- **Certificate / Articles of Incorporation**
- **Business Registration or License**

Documents must show your business’ **legal name** and the information being verified (address or phone number).

---

## Address Verification

Submit a document that links your business name to its address.

**Requirements:**

- Accepted document type
- Business legal name and address clearly visible
- Address entered **exactly as shown** on the document

---

## Phone Number Verification (WhatsApp)

Phone number verification is completed via **WhatsApp**.

If your business phone number can receive a WhatsApp message, it can be verified.

**How it works:**

1. Enter your business phone number
2. A verification code is sent via WhatsApp
3. Enter the code to complete verification

**Requirements:**

- Phone number must be active
- WhatsApp must be installed and working on that number
- Device must be able to receive messages during verification

## Common Issues

### Information Doesn’t Match

If verification fails:

- Ensure the document shows the required information
- Enter details **exactly as written** on the document
- Use only accepted document types
- Confirm documents are not expired

### Phone Number Not Receiving Code

- Confirm the number is correct
- Make sure WhatsApp is active on the device
- Check internet connection
- Retry verification after a few minutes
