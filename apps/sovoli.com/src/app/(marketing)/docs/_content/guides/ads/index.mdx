## How Ads Work on Sovoli

Sovoli websites provides you with **program pages built to convert**.

People learn about the program first — price, dates, teachers, and what they’ll learn — before messaging you. This leads to fewer basic questions and more serious inquiries.

As visitors interact with the page, Sovoli **feeds that activity back to the ad system**, helping it show your ads to people who are more likely to sign up.

Based on the action you set on your ad, that is what they will optimize on.

## Choose Your Ad Type

There are two ways to run ads for your programs on Sovoli. Neither is "right" or "wrong"—each option works better for different situations.

The key is to pick the approach that matches where you are right now. Are you ready to promote a specific program with all the details in place? Or are you still figuring out which programs people want most?

Read through both options below, and choose the one that fits your current situation. You can always try the other approach later if your needs change.

### One Program Ads

This means you're advertising one specific program only. For example, you might run ads just for your "Level 2 Beauty Therapy" course, or only for your "Morning Yoga for Beginners" class.

**This works best when:**

- Your program page is already set up on Sovoli with all the details filled in
- You have clear information about how long the program lasts, what it costs, and what people will learn
- You know what outcomes or skills students will have when they finish

**What to expect:**

When everything is ready, this approach usually gives you better results for getting people to sign up. Since visitors land on a complete program page, they can see everything they need to make a decision. They're more likely to contact you when they're actually ready to enroll.

**What can go wrong:**

If your program page is missing important details, visitors will be confused. They might click on your ad, look at an incomplete page, and leave without contacting you. Before running ads for a single program, make sure your page has:

- Clear pricing information
- Program duration or schedule
- What people will learn or achieve
- Any requirements or prerequisites

If any of these are missing, visitors won't have enough information to make a decision, and your ad budget will be wasted.

### Multiple Program Ads

This means you're advertising several programs at once. For example, you might show ads that mention three different beauty courses, or promote your entire schedule of fitness classes.

**This is useful when:**

- Your programs are new and you're not sure which ones people want most
- You want to test what people are interested in before focusing your efforts
- You're still building out the details for individual program pages

**What to expect:**

When you advertise multiple programs together, you'll usually get fewer signups at first compared to focusing on one program. This is normal and expected.

People who click on these ads will see an overview of all your programs. They'll browse through different options, maybe read about a few that interest them, and then decide what to do. Some people will contact you, but many will simply leave after looking around.

**Think of this as learning, not selling:**

This approach is best when your main goal is to learn what people are interested in. You're not expecting many enrollments right away. Instead, you're watching which programs get the most attention, which pages people spend time reading, and what questions people ask.

Use this information to decide which program to focus on next. Once you know what people want, you can create a complete page for that program and then run "One Program Ads" for better results.

## How to Know If Ads Are Working

Getting WhatsApp messages from your ads doesn't always mean your ads are working well. Some people message just to ask basic questions that could have been answered on your website. Others message but never follow through with enrollment.

Here are simple signs that your ads are actually working:

**People are clicking on your programs**

When visitors land on your website, they're clicking through to read about specific programs. This shows they're interested enough to learn more, not just browsing and leaving immediately.

**People are reading your pages**

Visitors are spending time on your program pages, not leaving after just a few seconds. This means they're finding useful information and considering whether your program is right for them.

**People are asking specific questions**

When people contact you on WhatsApp, they're asking meaningful questions. They might ask about scheduling conflicts, payment plans, or prerequisites. They're not asking what the program is about or how much it costs—those details are already on your website.

**What this means:**

If you're seeing these signs, your ads are doing their job. People are learning about your programs, getting interested, and reaching out when they're serious about enrolling.

If you're not seeing these signs, it might mean your program pages need more information, or you're advertising programs that don't match what people are looking for. Take a step back, review your content, and try a different approach.

Remember, good results take time. Don't expect everything to work perfectly in the first week. Give your ads some time to reach people, and pay attention to the quality of the responses you're getting, not just the number of messages.

## Common Mistakes

Here are some common mistakes people make when running ads, and how to avoid them:

**Promoting many programs before your website is ready**

Running ads for multiple programs can be useful for learning what people want. But if your program pages are empty or missing key details, visitors will leave confused and you'll waste your ad budget.

Before running any ads, make sure at least one program page is complete with pricing, duration, and what people will learn. It's better to advertise one complete program than several incomplete ones.

**Expecting signups too quickly**

Ads don't work like flipping a switch. People need time to see your ad, visit your website, read about your programs, think about it, and then contact you. Some people will message you immediately, but many will take days or weeks to decide.

Don't judge your ads after just a few days. Give them at least a week or two to reach people and let them make decisions. If you're getting quality messages and website visits, your ads are working—even if enrollments take a bit longer.

**Sending people to WhatsApp without context first**

Some business owners want ads to send people straight to WhatsApp. This seems faster, but it actually makes things harder for everyone.

When people contact you without seeing your website first, they ask basic questions you've already answered online. You end up repeating the same information over and over. These conversations take longer and lead to fewer signups because people haven't had time to think about whether your program is right for them.

Let your website do the explaining first. When people contact you after reading about your program, your conversations are more productive and you're more likely to get actual enrollments.

**The bottom line:**

Running ads successfully takes preparation and patience. Make sure your program pages have the information people need. Give your ads time to work. And trust that letting people learn about your programs before contacting you will lead to better results in the long run.
