## How Ads Work on Sovoli

Sovoli websites provides you with **program pages built to convert**.

People learn about the program first — price, dates, teachers, and what they’ll learn — before messaging you. This leads to fewer basic questions and more serious inquiries.

As visitors interact with the page, Sovoli **feeds that activity back to the ad system**, helping it show your ads to people who are more likely to sign up.

Based on the action you set on your ad, that is what they will optimize on.

## Choose Your Ad Type


Sovoli is built for businesses that **learn from data**.

Ads can serve the following purposes:

1. **Lead Generation & Sales**
2. **Demand Testing**

### Lead Generation & Sales

Use this when you are looking for **sales qualified leads** that you can call. This requires educating them.

A well fleshed out program details page exists as your digital brochure and sales page.

It is designed for:

- Focused attention capture
- Sales driven content
- Lead & intent capture

Your ad strategy should be a very focused graphics/video with messaging of a **single program** that sends traffic to its dedicated page.

Our tracking system will then teach the ads system to find you more of those leads.

### Demand Testing

Use this when you want to **compare demand across multiple programs**, not generate leads. Do not expect conversions.

Demand testing intentionally increases choice. Attention is spread across programs, which:
- Increases decision-making load
- Reduces depth of education
- Lowers immediate sales intent

This setup is designed to capture **interest signals**, not close sales.

Your ad strategy should promote **multiple programs** and send traffic to the program listing page.

Our tracking system then shows what users click on, reveals which programs attract attention, and still feeds conversion signals back to the ad system so it can learn which audiences are more likely to convert later.
### Rule of Thumb

- **Sales → program page**
- **Testing → listing page**
