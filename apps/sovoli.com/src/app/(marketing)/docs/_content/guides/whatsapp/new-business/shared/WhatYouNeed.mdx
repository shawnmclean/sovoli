## What You Need Before You Start

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A phone (Android or iPhone) that can receive text messages and calls
- A phone number you can use for your business
- A stable internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data)
- Access to the phone number for verification (you'll receive a code)

<Alert color="warning">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Don't use your personal WhatsApp number for business. Get a separate number for your business. If you use your personal number, customers will see your personal profile, and you won't be able to switch back easily.
