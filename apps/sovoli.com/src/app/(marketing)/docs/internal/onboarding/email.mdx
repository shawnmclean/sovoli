## 🛠️ Step 2: Verify Domain Ownership

To activate your Workspace:

1. Follow the instructions to verify your domain ownership.
2. Add a **TXT record** to the DNS provider (e.g. [Vercel](https://vercel.com)).


## 👥 Step 3: Staff Email Accounts

Each staff member should receive a personalized email account.

Naming convention:

```
firstname@domain.com           → e.g. shawn@ma.edu.gy
firstname.lastinitial@domain.com → e.g. shawn.m@ma.edu.gy (fallback)
```

Collect each user's personal backup email for account recovery.
