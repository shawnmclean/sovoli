# 🛠️ Sovoli Tenant Onboarding (Internal Protocol)

This is a **manual record** of each step taken to onboard a new tenant into Sovoli. It serves as an operational journal and foundation for future automation.

## 1. 🎯 Purpose

Document each action required to:

- Digitize and onboard a private school or organization.
- Set up web presence, internal tools, and communication infra.

### ✅ Actions Taken:

- [ ] Collected org name, type, description, address.
- [ ] Uploaded logo, banner images.
- [ ] Captured key contacts (admin, IT support).

### 💾 Storage Location:

## 3. 📄 Document Collection

- Business registration
- Educational certifications (for `.edu.gy`)
