# Tenant Onboarding

Welcome to the Sovoli onboarding guide. This document walks you through the process of getting a new organization — such as a private school, training institute, or small business — fully set up on the Sovoli platform.

---

## 1. Organization Data Collection

The first step is to gather essential organizational details:

- **Name** – Full name of the organization
- **Description** – A short overview of what they do
- **Type** – Choose from: `School`, `Training Institute`, `Business`, or `Other`
- **Logo** – PNG/JPEG, minimum 512x512 recommended
- **Key Documents** (optional but required for some domains):
  - Business registration or school approval letter
  - Staff or team photos (used on the public site)
  - Any relevant licensing or accreditation documents

This information is used for internal configuration and public site display.

---

## 2. Slug Selection (Website Subdomain)

Each tenant selects a **unique slug**, which becomes their Sovoli site URL:

https://[slug].sovoli.com


> Slugs should be lowercase, without spaces or special characters.

This subdomain is automatically provisioned and used to serve the organization's public website.

---

## 3. Custom Domain Registration

Organizations may opt to register or connect a custom domain:

- `.edu.gy` – Requires document verification and a manual approval process
- `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, etc. – Can be auto-registered or mapped via DNS

We assist with:

- DNS record configuration
- SSL certificate provisioning (via Let's Encrypt)
- Redirects from Sovoli subdomain to the custom domain

---

## 4. Email Creation

Once the domain is active, Sovoli provisions branded email accounts:

- `admin@[custom-domain]` (default)
- Up to 5 additional staff emails (e.g., principal@, admissions@, info@)

Email is managed via Sovoli's email integration and is connected to the contact form, application flow, and notifications.

---

## 5. SEO and Search Engine Submission

To improve discoverability, Sovoli automates key SEO tasks:

- Generates and submits a sitemap to Google
- Adds meta and Open Graph tags to pages
- Registers the site with **Google Search Console**
- Sets up **Google Business Profile** (if applicable)

For `.edu.gy` domains, this legitimizes the organization and improves search ranking significantly.

---

## 6. WhatsApp & Communication Channels (Optional)

To improve communication and engagement:

- Add a **Join WhatsApp Group** button
- Configure direct chat links for inquiries
- Telegram or Signal support coming soon

These buttons can be added to the homepage or contact page.

---

## 7. Booking & Application Flow (Optional)

Sovoli supports embedded flows for lead generation:

### Schedule a Visit

- Visitor enters WhatsApp number or email
- Verifies identity via token
- Selects date/time from available slots
- Admin is notified via email or WhatsApp

### Apply Now

- For student/guardian or client intake
- Uploads documents, selects program
- Admin receives structured applicant data

---

## 8. Team, Program & Services Setup

Once the foundation is in place, tenants can configure:

- **Team Members** – Name, title, bio, photo
- **Programs or Services** – Description, eligibility, price (if applicable)
- **News & Events** – Optional blog-style updates
- **Testimonials** – From parents, clients, or students

These populate the public site and are also useful for marketing and trust-building.

---

## 9. SIS & Internal Tools Integration (For Schools)

Sovoli's Student Information System is activated once the public presence is live:

- Student and guardian profiles
- Academic records
- Document uploads
- Class and cohort assignments
- Attendance and gradebook features (optional phase)

---

## 10. Launch and Handover

Once all steps are complete:

- Website goes live
- Admin access is granted
- Staff receive documentation or optional training
- Support channels are opened for troubleshooting

---

## Additional Notes

- Each step can be customized based on org type
- You can skip optional phases and revisit later
- Sovoli will auto-upgrade features as new modules are released
