## What You Need Before You Start

Before beginning the setup process, make sure you have:

- A phone that can receive SMS messages or phone calls (required for verification)
- A phone number that you can access and control
- Access to the phone during setup and ongoing use (the primary phone must remain active)

### Device Requirements


**Important**: The phone number must be able to receive SMS or calls for verification purposes. You cannot use a phone number that doesn't support SMS or voice calls.

## Step 1: Get a New Phone Number

You'll need a dedicated phone number for your business WhatsApp account. In Guyana, common SIM card providers include **Digicel** and **GTT**.

### Option A: Physical SIM + Phone

1. Visit a Digicel or GTT store to purchase a new SIM card
2. Choose a prepaid or postpaid plan that includes SMS and voice calling
3. Insert the SIM card into a phone (this will be your primary phone)
4. Ensure the phone number is activated and can receive SMS and calls

### Option B: eSIM

1. Contact Digicel or GTT to see if they offer eSIM support
2. If available, request an eSIM activation for a new number
3. Set up the eSIM on your phone (this phone will become your primary phone)
4. Verify the number can receive SMS and calls

**Note**: The phone with this number (whether physical SIM or eSIM) will be your primary phone for WhatsApp Business and must remain active for the account to function properly.

## Step 2: Install WhatsApp Business on the Primary Phone

1. Open the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android) on your primary phone
2. Search for "WhatsApp Business"
3. Download and install the official WhatsApp Business app
4. Once installed, open the app
5. Tap "Agree and Continue" to accept the Terms of Service
6. Enter your business phone number (the number from Step 1)
7. Tap "Next"
8. WhatsApp will send a verification code via SMS or phone call
9. Enter the verification code when prompted
10. Complete the verification process

## Step 3: Complete Basic Business Setup

After verification, you'll be guided through basic business setup:

1. **Business Name**: Enter your business name as you want it to appear to customers
2. **Business Category**: Select the category that best describes your business
3. **Business Description**: Add a brief description of what your business does
4. **Business Address** (optional): Enter your business location
5. **Business Hours** (optional): Set your business operating hours
6. **Profile Photo**: Upload your business logo or profile image

Take your time with these details, as they'll be visible to customers who message you.

## Step 4: Link Other Phones or Computers

WhatsApp Business supports one primary phone and multiple linked devices. Linked devices allow you to access your WhatsApp Business account from other phones or computers, but they do NOT log in with your phone number—they link to your primary phone instead.

### On the Primary Phone

1. Open WhatsApp Business on your primary phone
2. Tap the three-dot menu (Android) or Settings (iOS)
3. Go to "Linked Devices" or "WhatsApp Web/Desktop"
4. Tap "Link a Device"
5. A QR code will appear on your screen

### On the Other Device

**For a computer:**
1. Open a web browser and go to web.whatsapp.com
2. Scan the QR code displayed on your primary phone
3. Wait for the connection to be established

**For another phone:**
1. Open WhatsApp Business on the other phone
2. Go to Settings > Linked Devices
3. Tap "Link a Device"
4. Scan the QR code from your primary phone

**Important**: Linked devices depend on your primary phone being connected to the internet and active. The primary phone must remain powered on and connected for linked devices to work.

## Important Rules

- **One primary phone**: WhatsApp Business supports exactly one primary phone. This is the phone with the SIM card/eSIM you verified during setup.

- **Primary phone must stay active**: The primary phone must remain powered on, connected to the internet, and have WhatsApp Business running for your account to function. If the primary phone is off or disconnected, linked devices will also stop working.

- **Linked devices don't log in with phone number**: Linked devices connect to your primary phone, not directly to your phone number. You cannot log into a linked device using just your phone number and a verification code.

- **Multiple linked devices**: You can link multiple devices (computers, tablets, other phones) to your primary phone for convenient access.

- **Phone number access required**: Your phone number must be able to receive SMS or phone calls for verification and account recovery.

## Troubleshooting

**I can't receive the verification code:**
- Make sure your phone number can receive SMS or phone calls
- Check that you entered the correct phone number
- Try requesting the code via phone call instead of SMS (or vice versa)
- Ensure you have network coverage

**Linked devices won't connect:**
- Make sure your primary phone is turned on and connected to the internet
- Verify WhatsApp Business is running on your primary phone
- Try unlinking and re-linking the device
- Restart both the primary phone and the device you're trying to link

**My account stopped working:**
- Check if your primary phone is powered on and connected to the internet
- Ensure WhatsApp Business is still installed and running on the primary phone
- Verify your phone number still has active service
- Try restarting your primary phone

**I need to change my primary phone:**
- Unfortunately, you cannot change the primary phone for an existing WhatsApp Business account
- You would need to create a new WhatsApp Business account with the new phone number
- Make sure to backup any important conversations before making this change
