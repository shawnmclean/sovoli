# Project Instructions for AI Agents

## 🚨 STOP AND READ THIS FIRST 🚨

**MANDATORY**: You **MUST** read the [Business Protocol](docs/protocols/BUSINESS.md) before doing anything else.

> **Why?** It contains the "Scrappy Protocol" and the **Mandatory Implementation Plan Template**. If you skip this, you will be rejected.
> **Rule**: Even if you think your task is purely technical, purely media-related, or small—**READ THE BUSINESS PROTOCOL FIRST**.
